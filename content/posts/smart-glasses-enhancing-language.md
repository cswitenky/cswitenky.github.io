I work as a Software Engineer for XR: Accessibility Solutions Lab for 3 years now. This lab falls under the [Center on Culture and Language](https://www.rit.edu/ntid/nccl) (CCL) at [National Technical Institute for the Deaf](https://ntid.rit.edu) (NTID) in Rochester, New York. Center on Culture and Language's ultimate mission is to:

## Promote access and education through research, development, and mentorship related to cultural and linguistic characteristics and processes of deaf and hard of hearing communities

What we do at XR: Accessibility Solutions Lab helps to push this mission with the help of **extended reality (XR)** that encompasses: 
* virtual reality (VR)
* augmented reality (AR)
* mixed reality (MR)

We experiment with cutting-edge XR headset technology offerings from 
[Oculus](https://www.oculus.com), 
[Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/), 
[Vuzix](https://www.vuzix.com/), and
[Nreal](https://www.nreal.ai/).

Our lab focuses on developing [Access on Demand](https://www.accessondemand.io/), an accessibility tool for primary use on smart glasses for the deaf and hard of hearing. The software solution enables real-time captioning, interpreting, and speech recognition on glasses. We envision a use case in healthcare settings. Such a setting may require a deaf or hard of hearing person follow instructions when it is not convenient. For example, an instructor typically feeds instructions to the person while working under a fume hood which is not easy to do. Furthermore, the CPR test requires precise timing, and looking up to  receive instructions means an automatic failure. We hope this solution can help in those situations where the field of view limits communication.

At the moment, our software is compatible with three XR products: 
* [Microsoft HoloLens 2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens)
* [Nreal Light](https://www.nreal.ai/light/)
* [Vuzix Blade](https://www.vuzix.com/)

Rochester Institute of Technology hosts [Imagine RIT](https://www.rit.edu/imagine/) every April, where visitors can see students' hard work on exhibitions. We did this and won a $5,000 award from the TAD competition.
